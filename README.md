# SwiftRayTracer

A simple ray tracer largely based on amengede's work [here](https://github.com/amengede/getIntoMetalDev/tree/main/11%20Reflections/finished). The goal of this project is to compare ray tracing on the CPU and GPU. 

# Usage

Open the project in Xcode. You will probably have to change the developer team to your dev profile under the project settings. You can then run the project.
