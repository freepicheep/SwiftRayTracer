# SwiftRayTracer

A simple ray tracer largely based on amengede's work [here](https://github.com/amengede/getIntoMetalDev/tree/main/11%20Reflections/finished). He has a video explaining the process [here](https://youtu.be/GjOfrxjwiaU). 

The goal of this project is to compare ray tracing on the CPU and GPU. Currently, the program just renders a bunch of random spheres with random reflectivity. Once the program is launched, the `GameScene` is created and the same `GameScene` will be used for both the CPU and GPU raytracing so the comparison is fair. 

# Usage

Open the project in Xcode. You will probably have to change the developer team to your dev profile under the project settings. You can then run the project by clicking on the run button or by pressing `Command + R`.
